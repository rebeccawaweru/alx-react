Without reusing create-react-app or the code from the previous exercise, start a brand new npm project

Reusing what you learned during the Webpack module:

Set up a system to output a bundle.js file in a dist folder
Set up a dev server with hot reloading
Create a src folder that will contain your Javascript
Set up a simple html file in the dist folder that will import the bundle file in the body tag.
Install and configure the various plugins to support:

inline source map
style loader
css loader
image webpack loader
